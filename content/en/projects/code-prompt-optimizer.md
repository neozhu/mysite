## CodePrompt Optimizer

> ðŸš€ This project is generated by Firebase Studio

A Next.js (App Router) and React application designed for optimizing and comparing AI-generated code prompts. It enables you to quickly refine your prompts, then test and compare their outputs side-by-side to identify the best-performing version and enhance your coding productivity.

## Features

* **Prompt Optimization:** Employs an AI-driven workflow to refine your initial code prompts.
* **Example Testing:** Generates code outputs for both the original and the optimized versions of your prompts.
* **Output Comparison:** Allows side-by-side viewing of outputs and provides a summary of key differences.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Supports a range of common programming languages, including C#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go.
* **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides real-time notifications during optimization, testing, and comparison operations.
* **Convenient Source Access:** Includes a GitHub link in the header for easy navigation to the source code.

## Demo

* **Live Demo**: [https://codeprompt.blazorserver.com/](https://codeprompt.blazorserver.com/)
* **Source Repository**: [https://github.com/neozhu/codeprompts-optimizer](https://github.com/neozhu/codeprompts-optimizer)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neozhu/codeprompts-optimizer.git
    cd codeprompts-optimizer
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory with the following content:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
    Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4.  **Launch in development mode**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage Guide

1.  Select your desired programming language from the dropdown menu (C# is selected by default).
2.  Input your code prompt into the provided text area.
3.  Click the **Optimize Prompt** button to generate an AI-enhanced version of your prompt.
4.  Once the optimized prompt is available, click **Test Prompts** to view the code outputs generated by both the original and optimized prompts.
5.  Utilize the **Compare Outputs** feature to obtain a concise summary of the differences between the two outputs.
