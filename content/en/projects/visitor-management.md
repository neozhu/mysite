This Visitor Management System (VMS) streamlines the process of managing visitors to various institutions. It enables digital check-in, eliminating tedious manual registration and paperwork. The system also maintains a comprehensive log of every individual within the campus, including their entry and exit times.

Traditionally, institutions rely on security personnel to manually record visitor details in logbooks, a method prone to errors and difficult to reconcile. This manual process can also be inconvenient and time-consuming for visitors. This VMS addresses these challenges by simplifying registration, automating entry/exit tracking, and maintaining an accurate historical log, proving to be an invaluable tool for efficient visitor management.
