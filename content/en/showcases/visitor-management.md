The Visitor Management Workflow System is an internal approval platform built with Blazor Server. It is designed to streamline processes such as visitor access requests, exit permissions, gate pass management, and construction safety permit workflows.

Implemented using the robust open-source [CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer](https://github.com/neozhu/CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer) foundation, this system ensures maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns, making it ideal for enterprise-level workflow management.
