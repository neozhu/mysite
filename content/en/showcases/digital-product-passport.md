The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is an EU-driven initiative designed to enable transparent and traceable product information throughout the lifecycle of a product. Our DPP solution helps manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers access key product data easily, enhancing circular economy efforts and regulatory compliance.

This project was quickly built based on the open-source project [CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer](https://github.com/neozhu/CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer), offering a robust and scalable foundation for enterprise-grade applications using .NET and Blazor.
