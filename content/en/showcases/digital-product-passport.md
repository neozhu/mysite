The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is an EU-driven initiative designed to enable transparent and traceable product information throughout a product's lifecycle. Our DPP solution helps manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers easily access key product data, enhancing circular economy efforts and regulatory compliance.

Rapidly developed leveraging the open-source [CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer](https://github.com/neozhu/CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer) project, this solution provides a robust and scalable foundation for building enterprise-grade applications with .NET and Blazor.

## Key Features
