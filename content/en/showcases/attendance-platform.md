The Smart Attendance Platform is a modern solution designed to address the complex challenges of attendance tracking and labor settlement in labor dispatch outsourcing. It bridges the gap between labor agencies, host companies, employees, and platform administrators by enabling precise, real-time data collection and intelligent labor hour calculations through seamless integration with advanced attendance devices and facial recognition technology.

This project was quickly built based on the open-source project [CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer](https://github.com/neozhu/CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer), offering a robust and scalable foundation for enterprise-grade applications using .NET and Blazor.

## Key Features

- 📷 **Facial Recognition Attendance**: Seamless integration with HTTP-based smart devices to capture accurate attendance data.
- 🔁 **Real-Time Sync**: Immediate data synchronization from attendance machines to the backend for up-to-date records.
- 👥 **Multi-role Support**: Designed for labor agencies, host companies, employees, and platform managers.
- 🌍 **Multi-site Management**: Efficiently handle attendance across different projects, regions, and work sites.
- ⏱️ **Automated Labor Hour Calculations**: Intelligent pairing of check-in/out records, overtime recognition, and work hour summary.
- 📊 **Clear Settlement Workflow**: Automatic generation of labor fee breakdowns and reconciliation reports.
- 📱 **Web & Mobile Access**: Manage and view attendance data anytime, anywhere.

## Project Background

Labor dispatch outsourcing often faces challenges such as inaccurate time tracking, disputes over work hours, and inefficient payroll reconciliation.
