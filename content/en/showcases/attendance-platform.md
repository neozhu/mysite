The Smart Attendance Platform is a modern solution designed to address the complex challenges of attendance tracking and labor settlement in the labor dispatch outsourcing sector. The platform bridges the information gap between labor agencies, host companies, employees, and platform administrators by enabling precise, real-time data collection and intelligent labor hour calculations through seamless integration with advanced attendance devices and facial recognition technology.

Developed rapidly leveraging the open-source [CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer](https://github.com/neozhu/CleanArchitectureWithBlazorServer) project, it provides a robust and scalable foundation for enterprise-grade applications utilizing .NET and Blazor technologies.

## Key Features
