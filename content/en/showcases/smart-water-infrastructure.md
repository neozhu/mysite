The Smart Water Infrastructure System is a modern water supply monitoring and control system built on IoT and Blazor technologies. It enables real-time data collection, intelligent analysis, and remote control of water systems using various smart devices, such as NB-IoT water meters, smart hydrants, smart valves, RTUs/PLCs, and environmental sensors.

Data from these devices—such as pipe pressure, flow rate, tank water level, turbidity, residual chlorine, and pump frequency—is transmitted via NB-IoT, fiber optics, GPRS, or Wi-Fi to the back-end system for processing, display, alerting, and control.

This platform is designed for multi-tenant deployment, allowing different user organizations to manage their water systems independently via PC or mobile devices using a web-based B/S architecture, native apps, or mini-programs.

## Key Features

- 💧 **End-to-End Monitoring**: Real-time data on pressure, flow, level, turbidity, chlorine, pump frequency, etc.
- 📡 **Multiple Communication Protocols**: Supports NB-IoT, GPRS, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, and more.
- 🧠 **Smart Alerts**: Configurable alert rules with repair dispatch and incident tracking.
- 🧩 **Multi-Tenant Support**: Each organization manages its own data and users.
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics**: Water usage trends, pressure charts, flow rates, and unit-based statistics.
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Access**: Accessible via PC, mobile apps, and WeChat mini-programs.
- 🔐 **RBAC Permission System**: Role-based access control with user-role-menu binding.
- 📈 **Modular Architecture**: Built using Clean Architecture for high scalability and maintainability.



## Project Background

As smart cities continue to evolve, traditional water management systems face growing demands for digitalization, automation, and real-time decision-making.  
This platform is designed to modernize utility operations, improve response time for water supply issues, and reduce maintenance costs through real-time IoT integration and centralized data control.



## Architecture 

- **System Architecture**: Requirements analysis, prototypes, database design, and overall structure.
- **Tenant & User Management**: Supports multi-unit, multi-building structures with custom permissions.
- **Device Management**: Manage equipment details, maintenance, spares, lifecycle, and audits.
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time dashboards, interactive charts (line, bar, pie), and data queries.
- **Alert Management**: Alert rules, repair dispatching, and escalation tracking.
- **Analytics Module**: Historical usage, comparisons, and segmented reports by unit or region.
- **Reports & Printing (Planned)**: Export pressure, flow, temperature data and event records.
- **3rd-Party Integration**: Designed to be extensible with external hardware and platforms.
