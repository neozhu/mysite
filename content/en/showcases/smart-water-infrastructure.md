The Smart Water Infrastructure System is a modern water supply monitoring and control system built on IoT and modern web technologies. It enables real-time data collection, intelligent analysis, and remote control of water systems using various smart devices, such as NB-IoT water meters, smart hydrants, smart valves, RTUs/PLCs, and environmental sensors.

Data acquired from these diverse devices—including parameters like pipe pressure, flow rate, tank water levels, turbidity, residual chlorine, and pump frequency—is transmitted via various communication protocols (NB-IoT, fiber optics, GPRS, or Wi-Fi) to the backend system. This data is then processed for real-time display, intelligent alerting, and comprehensive control.

The platform supports a multi-tenant architecture, enabling different organizations to independently manage their respective water systems. Access is provided via PCs or mobile devices through a web-based interface (B/S architecture), native mobile applications, or dedicated mini-programs.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 💧 **Comprehensive Real-Time Monitoring:** Covers critical parameters such as pressure, flow rates, water levels, turbidity, residual chlorine, pump frequency, and more.
- 📡 **Versatile Communication Protocol Support:** Compatible with NB-IoT, GPRS, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, and other standard communication technologies.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Alerting System:** Features configurable alert rules, automated repair dispatch notifications, and comprehensive incident tracking capabilities.
- 🧩 **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Allows each client organization to securely manage its own data, users, and system configurations independently.
- 📊 **Advanced Data Analytics:** Provides insights through water usage trend analysis, interactive pressure charts, flow rate monitoring, and detailed unit-based consumption statistics.
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Users can access the system via desktop PCs, dedicated mobile applications (iOS/Android), and WeChat mini-programs.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Employs a granular RBAC system, allowing flexible assignment of permissions through user-role-menu bindings.
- 📈 **Modular and Scalable Design:** Developed using Clean Architecture principles for high scalability, maintainability, and ease of future enhancements.

## Project Background

As smart city initiatives advance, traditional water management systems increasingly struggle to meet the demands for digitalization, automation, and real-time decision-making.  
This platform aims to modernize utility operations by significantly improving response times to water supply issues and reducing maintenance costs through robust real-time IoT integration and centralized data control.

## Architecture Overview

- **System Design & Planning:** Encompasses requirements analysis, prototyping, database schema design, and overall system architecture planning.
- **Tenant & User Administration:** Manages multi-unit and multi-building organizational structures with customizable, role-based user permissions.
- **IoT Device Management:** Includes comprehensive management of equipment details, maintenance schedules, spare parts inventory, device lifecycle tracking, and audit trails.
- **Data Visualization & Dashboards:** Features real-time operational dashboards and interactive charts (line, bar, pie graphs) for intuitive data exploration and querying.
- **Intelligent Alert Management:** Provides tools for configuring alert rules, dispatching repair teams, and tracking alert escalations through to resolution.
- **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:** Offers modules for analyzing historical water usage, performing comparative analysis, and generating segmented reports by unit or geographical region.
- **Custom Reports & Printing (Planned Feature):** Future capability to export operational data (pressure, flow, temperature) and event logs into printable report formats.
- **Third-Party System Integration:** Architected for extensibility, allowing straightforward integration with external hardware devices and software platforms.
